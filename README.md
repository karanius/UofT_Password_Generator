# passwordGenerator
This app will generate a random password between 8 to 128 chars (a mix of diff chars if you may choose)

It was an intresting experience. Had a few data processing issues which I learned to handle. Tried to work on the UI as much as I could with CSS.. specially with the checkboxes.

My fave probelm that I solved was: learning that since the computer chooses the letters randomly, at a length of only 8 chars and mixing 4 different types of char, the chances of using at least 1 character from each set drops significantly. Wrote an extra validation section, so everyt time it generates a password, it will check to see at least one char from each "chosen" set is used.

Tried to implement a bit of animation for when data is copied to the clipboard. It's cute.
